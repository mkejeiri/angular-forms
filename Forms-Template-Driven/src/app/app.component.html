      <!-- 
            In the 'ts' we use form:ElementRef and it doesn't give access to the JS created by angular,
            we can set #f to something exposed by angular, we know that the form element 
            is kind of a selector for a directive build into angular which will create 
            automatically a JS object and then it will automatically expose some data that
            we could fetch in the form element, we can do it by : #f="ngForm" -> it just a way
            of saying to angular give me access to the form that you automatically created.
            onSubmit(form:ElementRef) will become onSubmit(form:NgForm) -->


      <!-- the following approach's been replaced: 
        <form (ngSubmit) ="onSubmit(f)" #f="ngForm">  by <form (ngSubmit) ="onSubmit()" #f="ngForm"> 

            B E C A U S E :

      to get access to the form from 'ts' we will use ViewChild('f') using a local ref '#f' 
      instead of passing it as param to onSubmit(f) method, this approach gives us full access 
      to the form in 'ts' all times, not only when we submit it!!!!, it's very important to get access
       to the form from 'ts' to control  its validity and enhance the user experience!
      
        @ViewChild('f') signUpForm:NgForm;

          will be triggered and form will be submitted, it will trigger JS submit event, 
          this is how it is built in the HTML...
          to prevent this, angular provides us with a directive ngSubmit (to be placed in the form tag) 
          which listen to submit event=(ngSubmit)

         1- we could group all relevant data input by using (ngModelGroup="userData")  userData will be turn

              gender: "male",questionAnswer:"message",secret:"pet",
              userData: {username: "username", email: "email@email.com"}

          2- now, we could also check the validity of email and username in one shot on userData control!!!
          3- #userData="ngModelGroup" allow us to access userData control in template:e.g, userData.valid
        -->

                - use ngModel to tell angular that this is a control
                - use #username="ngModel" to get access to username input in the template (e.g. username.valid)
