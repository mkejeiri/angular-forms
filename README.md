# Simple example about *Forms* in Angular 

----
## We explore in details two ways on how to operate with *Forms* in Angular
>  - 'Template-Driven' approach: Angular infers the form Object from the DOM.
>  - 'Reactive' approach : Form is created programmatically in Typescript and synchronized with the DOM.

----
## Usage:

    1. get inside on either 'Forms-reactive' or 'Forms-Template-Driven' directory
    2. npm install
    3. ng serve

##### You may also need to run the following (i.e bootstrap package has been removed from angular newer versions!):

    npm install bootstrap@3.3.7
